Prima Membership Installation

The installation process is extremely simple, the Test Utility
automatically performs the system compatibility check. Besides the
fields requiring technical details are also automatically filled in,
though can be changed manually if necessary. To install Prima Membership
an administrator has to pass through the following steps:

Unzip it either directly to some server folder or locally. If you unzip the
software locally please load all the unzipped files and folders to
your server using any FTP manager ONLY IN BINARY MODE. After that
please enter the full path to the Prima Membership in your browser address
bar (e.g. http://mydomain.my/pmembership/) and the installation
process will start.

The process starts with the welcome screen where one can get
acquainted with the general information about the software and the
company-developer.

After pushing the next button on the welcome screen page the NS System
Test Utility performs the automatic compatibility check, if it detects
any compatibility issues a user is taken to the page where the list of
errors is displayed and it is impossible to continue installation
until all the errors are eliminated; in case the software is fully
compatible with the system a user is taken to the Terms of service
page where it is necessary to read carefully all the terms and agree
to them. A user has to check the "I agree" box to be able to continue
the installation.

By clicking "Next" on the Terms of service page a user proceeds to the
System settings where it is possible to configure General, Database
and Date-time settings. The fields "Script URL", "Absolute path" and
"IP address" in the General Settings are filled in automatically (a
user is able to change them manually but it is highly recommended not
to change the automatically detected values, unless an administrator
is completely sure of what he/she is doing). If the values in the
Database Settings appear invalid the warning icon with a tooltip is
displayed beside the settings and it is not possible to continue the
installation. It is also highly recommended not to change the value in
the "DB table prefix" field. A user may change System settings later
when logged in as an administrator in the System configuration
section.

After clicking "Next" on the System settings page a user is directed
to the Admin settings page. The Super administrator's account is set
on this page. It is obligatory to give a valid e-mail address as the
password for the super admin is generated automatically (for security
reasons) and sent to the specified e-mail address along with the login
details. Thus, the e-mail address MUST BE CORRECT to avoid the
reinstallation of the software. If for any reason it is impossible to
send an e-mail with the login details, this information is displayed
on the next page (the last page with the confirmation of the
successful installation).

After filling in the super admin information a user proceeds to the
Final page with the confirmation of successful registration.

Please mind that it is very IMPORTANT to configure the server
time-based scheduling service correctly. It is necessary for
Prima Membership to close member subscriptions, to inform members of
different events in time. The correct configuration is also important
for e-mail sending. Here is the step-by-step example of the server
time-based scheduling service configuring (we used Cron):

WARNING! PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL! Do NOT lose super admin's login or
password, they cannot be recovered as we do NOT leave backdoors for
security reasons.
